    <h2>My Research</h2>

    <h3>Working Project 1: Need Based Aid for the Not Too Needy</h3>
    <p>I present new evidence on the effects of need-based grant programs for the middle-class. Using data from the National Association of State Student Grant Aid Programs and 
      the Integrated Postsecondary Education System from 2011-2019, I use a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to estimate effects of the first major need-based program in California, 
      the Middle Class Scholarship Program of 2015. I compare outcomes at University of California and California State schools to synthetic outcomes at other public universities in the United States. 
      I evaluate total enrollments and graduation rates before and after program introduction.</p>
